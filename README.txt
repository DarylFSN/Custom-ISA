a. We have 3 folders, one folder for each program, which contains the .sv files,
the test benches for ALU, PC, and TopLevel, the assembly code (assembly.txt), and 
the generated machine code (machinecode.txt). At the top level, there is also the 
assembler file (assembler.py) we used, its usage file (usage.txt), as well as 
this README.txt.

b. All 3 programs work and pass all the test cases.
